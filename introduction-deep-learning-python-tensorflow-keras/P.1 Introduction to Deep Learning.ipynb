A hidden layer is just in between your input and output layers. One hidden layer means you just have a neural network. Two or more hidden layers? Boom, you've got a deep neural network!\n",

    "So this is really where the magic happens. The idea is a single neuron is just sum of all of the inputs x weights, fed through some sort of activation function. The activation function is meant to simulate a neuron firing or not. A simple example would be a stepper function, where, at some point, the threshold is crossed, and the neuron fires a 1, else a 0. Let's say that neuron is in the first hidden layer, and it's going to communicate with the next hidden layer. So it's going to send it's 0 or a 1 signal, multiplied by the weights, to the next neuron, and this is the process for all neurons and all layers."

Solving for this problem, and building out the layers of our neural network model is exactly what TensorFlow is for. TensorFlow is used for all things \"operations on tensors.\" A tensor in this case is nothing fancy. It's a multi-dimensional array.\n",

If you're familiar with Keras previously, you can still use it, but now you can use tensorflow.keras to call it. By that same token, if you find example code that uses Keras, you can use with the TensorFlow version of Keras too. In fact, you can just do something like:"
